To run an executable as a desktop file and have its output displayed in a terminal without opening an additional terminal window, you can create a custom desktop launcher file. Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Create a Desktop File**:
   Create a `.desktop` file for your application. You can do this by opening a text editor and creating a file like `myapp.desktop`. Here's an example of what the file might look like:

   ```plaintext
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=My Application
   Exec=gnome-terminal -- bash -c "/path/to/your/executable; read -n 1"
   Type=Application
   Terminal=true
   ```

   - `Name`: The name of your application.
   - `Exec`: This is where you specify the command to run your executable in a terminal. Replace `/path/to/your/executable` with the actual path to your executable.
   - `Type`: Set it to `Application`.
   - `Terminal`: Set it to `true` to indicate that this should run in a terminal.

2. **Make the Desktop File Executable**:
   Run the following command to make your `.desktop` file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x /path/to/your/myapp.desktop
   ```

3. **Place the Desktop File in the Right Directory**:
   Move the `.desktop` file to one of the following directories based on your desktop environment:

   - For GNOME: `~/.local/share/applications/`
   - For KDE: `~/.local/share/applications/`
   - For Xfce: `~/.local/share/applications/`
   - For Unity: `~/.local/share/applications/`

4. **Launch the Application**:
   You should now be able to search for and launch your application from your desktop environment's application menu. It will run in a terminal window, and the terminal will remain open until you press a key (due to the `read -n 1` part of the `Exec` command).

This setup will execute your application in a terminal, and the terminal will close automatically after you interact with it. The `read -n 1` command at the end ensures that the terminal stays open until you press a key.
